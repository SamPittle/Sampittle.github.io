    <p>Allow me to introduce myself, My name is Sam Pittle and I am currently a student studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island.
      I was born in Kansas but have lived in Rhode Island my entire life. I currently live in Richmond, Rhode Island with my beautiful wife and two children.
      I am a Sergeant in the Rhode Island Army National Guard and have been serving in the military
    since 2011. My hobbies are many different kinds of martial arts such as Muay Thai, Brazilian Jui Jitsu, Karate, Judo, Krav Maga, and Kung Fu. I also love to play video games
    and I am not ashamed to say that I love pokemon, a love that I have been able to share with my two beautiful children.</p>
